Password Policy 🔐
Overview
Passwords are a key part of our cyber security strategy. The purpose of this policy
is to make sure all resources and data receive adequate password protection. We
cannot overstate the importance of following a secure password policy and
therefore have provided this document for your guidance. The policy covers all
users who are responsible for one or more account or have access to any resource
that requires a password.

Password Creation:
• All passwords should be su ciently complex and therefore di cult for anyone to
guess.
• In addition, employees should also use common sense when choosing
passwords. They must avoid basic combinations that are easy to crack. For
instance, choices like “password,” “password1” and “Pa$$w0rd” are equally bad
from a security perspective.
• A password should be unique, with meaning only to the user who chooses it.
• In some cases, it will be necessary to change passwords at certain frequencies.
• Default passwords — such as those created for new users — must be changed
as quickly as possible. For example the default password of “funnel123#!#” must
be changed immediately.
